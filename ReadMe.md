##Welcome to the Park Republic Mobile App

This is the root directory for the Park Republic PhoneGap application. In addition to other resources, this folder also contains the working apk file entitled localPR_debug.apk, which is a build made on the PhoneGap site from the compressed ‘www’ folder where all the program files are contained. The app can be emulated by loading the apt into an emulator, mobile phone, or this can simply be done by opening the index.html file in the ‘www’ folder.

We hope you enjoy your experience of Park Republic.
